### Guide
Ramp early and often with a horde of low cost mana dorks, then get Ragga out for protection with a +2/+2 anthem for each of them. With Ragga on the field, you can attack with any mana dork(s), and immediately untap any that survive the combat, allowing you to swing and then also tap for mana in your second main phase.

Once your board state has ramped a bit, it's time to cast some big spells, as anything at 7 or higher cost will proc Ragga's other ability, letting you give certain creatures trample and a huge boost to damage. To facilitate this, there are several stompy creatures in the deck at 7 or higher cost, as well as a bunch of X spells that you can inflate to meet the cost threshold.
