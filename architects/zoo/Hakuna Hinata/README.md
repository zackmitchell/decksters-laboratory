### Guide
The primary goal of this deck is to get Hinata on the field, keep them protected, then rely on their discount ability to manipulate portions of the board state with a variety of X cost, multi-target spells.

The portion of the ability that makes targeted spells cost more for opponents usually makes her a prime target for removal, so it's often better to get some cheaper support creatures setup on the field rather than calling upon Hinata immediately. This gives time to ramp and more opportunities to protect them once they're out.

You can get very creative with the multi-target spells - untapping all of your own lands or even copying them with a select few included spells, to magnify the effect being applied broadly.
