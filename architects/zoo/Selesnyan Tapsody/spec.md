### Guide
Navigate combat tactically, limiting opponents' ability to block and attack you based on Mirri's status.

Mirri is a very tactical commander, who can be used to strike around players who may have wide creature defences, or keep you protected from massive swings from those same players' hordes. Beyond those mechanics and things to support them, there's just a lot of +1/+1 counter synergies.

Because Mirri's two abilities require her to be attacking or tapped, respectively - the deck includes options to have her attack safely (Maze of Ith), make her scarier to block (Poison the Blade), pump damage, and even to tap her manually (Swallow Whole, Pressure Point) to get her protection without risking a swing just to tap her.
