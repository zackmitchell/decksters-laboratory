### Guide
Play politically, encouraging opponents to swing at each other for card draw while Breena gets stronk.

Breena is all about board politics - your goal is to entice your opponents to attack each other for card draw while you reap the benefit of the counters. Her ability is worded in a complicated way, but basically boils down to the following (which can also proc by YOU attacking, if the other conditions are met):
- Whenever one of your opponents is attacked...
- If the target of the attack does NOT have the lowest life of all your opponents...
- The aggressor draws a card...
- And you assign the two +1/+1 counters

There's a fair deal of ramp (Monologue Tax, Black Market) and card advantage (Tenuous Truce, Wedding Ring) to keep you moving, with some at the tradeoff of a little lost life (Phyrexian Arena) or other criteria like sacrificing things. Generally you want to get her out early when people are making early swings and will be enticed by the card draw to not attack you. From there, there's many cards that goad opponents to attack each other instead of you (Martial Impetus, Vow of Torment) as well as global defense options (Ghostly Prison).

### Changelog
v1.1
- Swapped one board wipe for another that's more asymmetrical, to reduce potential of super long games with this deck. `Sculpted Sunburst` comes out, which does have some control over its wipe targets, but `Damning Verdict` is even better and will be a lot more of a one-sided wipe more often due to Breena's counter synergy.

v1.0
