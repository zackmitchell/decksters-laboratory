# The Copy-Cast Killer
## Overview
### Details
```
Architect: Zoo
Commander: Zevlor, Elturel Exile
Color Identity: Grixis (BUR)
```

### Guide
Zevlor's ability means he can make single target spells hit something for each opponent, which is great - but because we're copying the original spell to do this, the vast majority of great value cards in the deck are ones that "DO SOMETHING" to a single target, but ALSO have something like "Draw a card", which will net you a bonus card for each opponent's copy.

One of the best examples of this power is Press the Enemy. If you pay 2 colorless and tap Zevlor for his ability, then cast Press the Enemy for 6 total mana altogether, you could return one non-land permanent to the hand of each opponent, and then cast - for free - 3 instants or sorceries, each equal to or less than the cost of one of the returned permanents.

Or do the same thing with Astarion's Thirst, which will let you exile one target creature from each opponents board, then sum the total power of all three exiled creatures and put that many +1/+1 counters on Zevlor. You can even get big bursts of mana if you Zevlor up a Jeska's Will, letting you add 1 red mana per card in every opponent's hand.
