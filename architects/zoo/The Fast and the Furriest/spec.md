### Changelog
v1.3
- Removed `Tocasia's Welcome` and slotted in `Arachnogenesis` which is very powerful in this deck. The card draw from `Tocasia's Welcome` is repeatable but only once a turn, and there's already `Tribute to the World Tree` and `Elemental Bond` for creature ETB card draw, plus other once-per-turn options like `Staff of the Storyteller`, so it comes out.

v1.2
- Swapped out `Raise the Alarm` for an `Aura Mutation`, which was always intended to be in the deck but only recently acquired. `Raise the Alarm` is the one to come out as `Aura Mutation` has the same CMC but can potentially create more than 2 catdogs.
