### Changelog
v1.5
- Removed `Roar of Resistence` and `Loyal Apprentice` in favor of two more manarocks, `Mind Stone` and `Fellwar Stone`. Also added in `Cathars' Crusade` because it can be insane.

v1.4
- Removed `Torens, Fist of the Angels` in order to add in `Ulasht, the Hate Seed` which could be super powerful and useful at making a decently established board of catdogs even scarier, converting its ETB +1/+1 counters to a horde of catdog tokens for 1 mana each.

v1.3
- Removed `Tocasia's Welcome` and slotted in `Arachnogenesis` which is very powerful in this deck. The card draw from `Tocasia's Welcome` is repeatable but only once a turn, and there's already `Tribute to the World Tree` and `Elemental Bond` for creature ETB card draw, plus other once-per-turn options like `Staff of the Storyteller`, so it comes out.

v1.2
- Swapped out `Raise the Alarm` for an `Aura Mutation`, which was always intended to be in the deck but only recently acquired. `Raise the Alarm` is the one to come out as `Aura Mutation` has the same CMC but can potentially create more than 2 catdogs.
