### Changelog
v1.2
- Notable additions include Questing Druid, Guttural Response, and Doubling Season

v1.1
- Renamed deck to "Armories & Auroras"
- Removed `Rishkar's Expertise` for cheaper, more repeatable card draw with `Season of Growth`
- Removed somewhat costly `Sword of Vengeance` for `Court of Garenbrig` which can scale up the counters really well
- Removed `Elemental Mastery` as this card might actually do better in the Jinnie Fay deck, and added `Primal Vigor` which can create 2x the menacing Spirits, and 2x the +1/+1 counters, which when combined is the entire deck's MO anyway

v1.0
- Init
